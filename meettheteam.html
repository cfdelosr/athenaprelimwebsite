            <div class="description3">Hey all! I'm Camille, a 3rd-year majoring in Public Health Policy and minoring in Health Informatics. Alongside my team, I feel passionate about developing ATHENA as it promotes women's wellness while using new technology that also closes the accessibility gap that many of us face. Hopefully, ATHENA can provide solutions for women who are going through the same thing.</div>

I'm excited about ATHENA because it helps bridge the connection between mental and physical well-being for women, which I think is something that is often overlooked or even dismissed. Also, a fun fact about me is that I love reading.</div>
